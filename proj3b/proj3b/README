- A Python script that analyzes a file system summary (a .csv file in the same format produced for the previous file system project) and reports on all discovered inconsistencies
- This includes Block Consistency Audits, I-node Allocation Audits, and Directory Consistency Audits
- usage: ./lab3b [CSV FILE NAME]
- Displays error message in the following formats:

lab3b.sh:
- shell script that runs lab3b.py with Python 3 and passes its parameters to the Python script

Makefile:
- supports the following targets:
  build (default) ... create hard link lab3b to lab3b.sh and make it executable
  lab3b ... create hard link lab3b to lab3b.sh and make it executable
  dist ... create the deliverable tarball
  clean ... delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
